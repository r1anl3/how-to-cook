- Maximum number of routers: $R_m$
- End devices that each router may have children: $D_m$
- Maximum deepth of tree: $L_m$
- Size of the address range: $A(d)$
	- $A(d) = 1 + D_m + R_m, \ \text{if} \ d = L_m - 1$ 
	- $A(d) = 1 + D_m + R_m \times A(d+1), \ \text{if} \ 0  \le d \lt L_m - 1$ 
- Router at depth $d$ 's address range: $R(x) = [x, x + A(d)]$

- Size of address range for each depth level:
	- $A(2) = 1 + 4 + 4 = 9$

## Optimized Link State Routing protocol - OLSR

### Theory

> *Note: You can find more documents in Lecture 5*

- Multipoint relay set - MPR(N): a set of 1-hop neighbor nodes that can transmit control packet from node N to 2-hop neighbor nodes

	- Example at node 4 ![](../img/Pasted%20image%2020240625174836.png)
	
- Multipoint relay selector set - MS(N): a set of SOURCE NODES (in 1-hop neighbor) selected N to forward THEIR broadcasted packets, to cover all 2-hop neighbor nodes

	- Example at node 3 ![](../img/Pasted%20image%2020240625174354.png)
	
- Neighbor list - NBR(N): a list of nodes that are indicated as node N's neighbors by sending and receiving HELLO message from node N, used to optimize MPR(N) NBR set.

	- Example at node 4![](../img/Pasted%20image%2020240625171316.png)
	
- Topology Control message - TC(N): a list of advertised neighbors (link information) and sequence number (to prevent use of state information). Only MPR nodes generate and probagate TC message

	- Example at node 3![](../img/Pasted%20image%2020240625172202.png)

### (Exercise) Find: MRP(1), MPR(12), MPR(5), MPR(14), MS(2), MS(9), MS(5), MS(1) following by this topology

![](../img/olsr.drawio.png)

- MPR(1) = {2, 3, 4, 5, 7}
- MPR(12) = {2}
- MPR(5) = {1, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- MPR(14) = {9, 15}
- MS(2) = {1, 12, 20}
- MS(9) = {5, 14}
- MS(5) = {1, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- MS(1) = {2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 25}

### (Exercise) Given an IoT network including 6 nodes, draw the topology based on the nodes' routing tables and indicate the routing path from Node 6 to Node 1

## Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector routing protocol - AODV

### Theory

> *Note: You can find more documents in Lecture 5*

AODV Route request

- Initiated when a node wants to communicate with another node, but does not have a route to that node
- Source node broadcasts a route request (RREQ) packet to its neighbors
- RREQ packet structure

	 - ![](../img/Pasted%20image%2020240625180623.png)
 
	- Broadcast ID (broadcast_id): is incremented for every RREQ packet sen
	- Source/destination address (source_addr, dest_addr): uniquely identifies the RREQ
	- Source sequence number (source_sequence): indicates “freshness” of reverse route to the source
	- Destination sequence number (dest_squence) indicates freshness of route to the destination
	
- When a neighbor receives the RREQ, it will return a route reply (RREP) packet, or forward RREQ to its neighbors
- Receivers can identify and discard duplicate RREQ packets

AODV Route Reply

- If a node receives an RREQ packet and it has a current route to the target destination, then it unicasts a route reply packet (RREP) to the neighbor that sent the RREQ packet
- RREP packet structure

	- ![](../img/Pasted%20image%2020240625181909.png)

	- Source/destination address (source_addr, dest_addr): uniquely identifies the RREP
	- Destination sequence number (dest_squence) indicates freshness of route to the destination
	- (lifetime) or (hop_count): increase in the RREP packet when packet is routed
	
- Other RREP packets are discarded unless: (dest_sequence_#) number is higher than the previous, or (destination_sequence_#) is the same but (hop_cnt) is smaller

### (Example) RREQ and RREP from node 1 to node 7

![](../img/Pasted%20image%2020240625183000.png)

- Node 1 needs to send a data packet to Node 7
- Assume Node 6 knows a current route to Node 7
- Assume that no other route information exists in the network (related to Node 7)

Routing steps

- **STEP 1**![](../img/Pasted%20image%2020240625183108.png)

	- Node 1 sends a RREQ packet to its neighbors![](../img/Pasted%20image%2020240625183254.png)

- **STEP 2** ![](../img/Pasted%20image%2020240625183404.png)

	- Nodes 2 and 4 verify that this is a new RREQ and that the source_sequence_# is not stale with respect to the reverse route to Node 1
	- Nodes 2 and 4 forward the RREQ
		- Update (source_sequence_#) for Node 1
		- Increment (hop_cnt) in the RREQ packet
		
- **STEP 3** ![](../img/Pasted%20image%2020240625183506.png)

	- RREQ reaches Node 6, which knows a route to 7
	- Node 6 must verify that the destination sequence number is less than or equal to the destination sequence number it has recorded for Node 7
	- Nodes 3 and 5 will forward the RREQ packet, but the receivers recognize the packets as duplicates

- **STEP 4** ![](../img/Pasted%20image%2020240625184315.png)

	- Node 6 knows a route to Node 7 and sends an RREP to Node 4 ![](../img/Pasted%20image%2020240625183713.png)

- **STEP 5** ![](../img/Pasted%20image%2020240625183737.png)

	- Node 4 verifies that this is a new route reply (the case here) or one that has a lower hop count
	- If so, propagates the RREP packet to Node 1 and increases (hop_cnt) in the RREP packet

- **STEP 6** ![](../img/Pasted%20image%2020240625184105.png)

	- Node 1 now has a route to Node 7 in three hops and can use it immediately to send data packets
	- Note that the first data packet that prompted path discovery has been delayed until the first RREP was returned
